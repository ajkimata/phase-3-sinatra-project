## Sinatra Full-Stack Web App Workout Swap

This is my first full-stack MVC app and has been designed to help people who want to workout at home. The idea is that most of the workouts will have minimal equipment. I hope you enjoy it!

## Installation

You can Clone or fork this repository and use straight away as the DB is already seeded and migrated. if you want to create ad new DB just delete the actual one and run in your terminal rake db:migrate to start with a new DB.

And then execute:

```
bundle install
```

Then run the application by entering:

```
shotgun
```

and a tab in your default browser will start the app at http://localhost:9393 .

Please then Sign Up with the form you see on that page and then begin to use the app!

## Usage

This app is designed to help people share home workouts. You can add your own workouts or copy others. Once added, you will see a list of all your workouts and you can edit/delete them as you please. You can also look at workouts created by other users on the site and copy them to your workouts if you wish to edit/delete them. You can also edit your profile in order to add further details about yourself. You can delete your account at any time. Logout by clicking the logout button top left. Make sure to remember your account details so that you can log back in later!
